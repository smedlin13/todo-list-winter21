<h3>John Muir Trail</h3>
<p>Covering almost 215 miles, I backpacked this trail with 2 other women. We spent the sunrise on the 3rd day on Mount Whitney, the highest peak in the lower 48. </p>

<h3>Kings Peak Overnighter</h3>
<p>My friend Anna and I set out to hike Kings Peak in two days. We hiked in 8 miles, woke up at 3 a.m. the next morning to summit Kings Peak, the highest point in Utah. Then we hiked out that same day. Not a recommended way to experience the gorgeous area, but was accomplished non-the-less!</p>

<h3>Bikepacking the Panguitch Trail - Guide</h3>
<p>My husband and I led a group of 7 cyclists on an overnight bikepacking trail in the canyon that parallels Bryce Canyon. We ate lunch at Tropic Reservoir and even had a gourmet chef (one of our friends) make fried chicken for the team to enjoy at the campsite.</p>

<h3>Grand Canyon - Guide</h3>
<p>A female-only trip (happenchance) resulted in 13 individuals romping through slot canyons, jumping in the green river, and downing goldfish all week long.</p>

  <h3>Parika Peak - Guide</h3>
  <p>For 3 summers, I backpacked with students in Rocky Mountain National park in the Never Summer Wilderness. As part of every weekly trip, we would hike to the top of Parika Peak and watch the sunrise.</p>
